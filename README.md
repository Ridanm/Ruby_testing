# RSpec Playground
The purpose of this [repository](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/ruby_testing) is to provide 'hands-on' RSpec lessons. These lessons were designed to equip students of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to write tests for their Tic-Tac-Toe and to TDD their Connect Four.
